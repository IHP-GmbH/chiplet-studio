# Coordinate Frame Contract — Chiplet Pipeline

**Owner:** chiplet-studio (reader and contract owner); all writers cite
this document by path.
**Companion:** [`CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md`](./CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md)
(general schema — this doc adds frame and anchor semantics).

---

## 0. TL;DR

1. All `position:` values in a `.chiplet` file are expressed in
   **GDS-bbox-corner of the interposer top_cell**, y-up cartesian,
   units micrometers.
2. `position:` is the component's **geometric center**, not its corner.
3. Each component declares an explicit `anchor:` field:
   - `anchor: gds_origin` — the component mesh is built around its own
     GDS (0,0). Used by dies produced by `gds_to_kicad`.
   - `anchor: bbox_center` — the component mesh is centered on its own
     GDS bounding box. Used by interposers.
4. Z-mounting for dies on connection stacks is fixed by the formula
   in §3.
5. `hyp_to_gds.py --update-chiplet-file` is **mandatory** in the
   canonical path. KiCad's `pcbnew` GUI export produces an
   intermediate `.chiplet` whose positions live in the wrong frame
   (PCB-bbox-corner) and is not directly consumable by chiplet-studio.

Any tool that writes a `.chiplet` file MUST conform to this contract.
Any tool that reads one MUST validate that the contract is followed
(or fail loudly).

---

## 1. Canonical Coordinate Frame

### 1.1 Definition

The canonical frame for `.chiplet` `position:` values is:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Reference object | Interposer's GDS top_cell |
| Origin (0, 0) | Lower-left corner of the interposer's GDS bbox |
| X axis | Increases rightward |
| Y axis | Increases upward (y-up cartesian) |
| Units | Micrometers (µm) |
| Float precision | At least 6 decimal places (1 pm theoretical) |

### 1.2 Why GDS-bbox-corner

- The GDS file is the physical fabrication artifact. The interposer
  GDS is the ground truth of the layout.
- KLayout, the 3D scene in chiplet-studio, and any downstream
  packaging tool all consume positions as offsets within the GDS
  bbox.
- The PCB Edge.Cuts bounding box (which KiCad uses natively) **does
  not always match** the GDS bbox. In the wire-bond demo the shift is
  (-200 µm, -780 µm) even though widths and heights agree to the µm.
  The GDS frame is the only one with no such hidden shift relative to
  what gets fabricated.

### 1.3 Diagram (top-down view)

```
                                  +--------------------------+
                                  |  GDS bbox of interposer  |
                                  |     (the reference)      |
                                  |                          |
                                  |    (die center)          |
                                  |        +                 |
                                  |       /                  |
                                  |      / position.y        |
                                  |     /                    |
                                  | (0,0)----- position.x    |
                                  +--------------------------+
                                  ^
                                  |
                          GDS-bbox-corner = canonical origin
```

`(0,0)` is the lower-left of the interposer's GDS bbox. Every
`position:` x and y in the .chiplet is measured from this corner,
y-up, in µm.

### 1.4 Position semantics

`position:` always refers to the component's **geometric center**.

For a die of width 1000 µm and height 2000 µm placed with its
lower-left corner at (250, 250) inside the interposer:
```yaml
position:
  x: 750.0      # 250 + 1000/2
  y: 1250.0     # 250 + 2000/2
  z: 61.83      # see §3 for Z mounting
dimensions:
  width: 1000.0
  height: 2000.0
  thickness: 50.0
```

The reader uses `position` and `dimensions` together to compute the
3D world placement (see §5).

---

## 2. Anchor Convention

### 2.1 The `anchor:` field

Each component declares how its local mesh is built:

| Value | Meaning | Use cases |
|---|---|---|
| `gds_origin` | The component mesh is built around its own GDS (0, 0). The `position:` value is added to the GDS-origin of the cell, no extra centering. | Dies produced by `gds_to_kicad` (footprint anchor at GDS (0,0)). Any die where the layout author put the cell origin where the placement reference should be. |
| `bbox_center` | The component mesh is centered on its own GDS bounding box. `position:` places the bbox center. | Interposers. Components whose GDS layout uses absolute pcbnew-derived coordinates and whose meaningful "placement reference" is the geometric center. |

The anchor is **declared by the writer** based on knowledge of how
the component's GDS was produced. The reader does **not** infer it
from `ComponentType`.

### 2.2 Default behavior

If `anchor:` is absent:
- The reader must default to `bbox_center` and emit a warning.
- This is for legacy `.chiplet` files only; there is no
  auto-migration.
- New files MUST declare `anchor:` explicitly.

### 2.3 Example

```yaml
components:
  - id: interposer
    type: interposer
    technology: interposer_tech
    anchor: bbox_center
    layout: ./interposer.gds
    top_cell: TOP
    position:
      x: 1326.576    # half of GDS bbox width = 2653.152 / 2
      y: 2313.005    # half of GDS bbox height = 4626.009 / 2
      z: 0
    dimensions:
      width: 2653.152
      height: 4626.009
      thickness: 13.83

  - id: U1
    type: die
    technology: sg13g2
    anchor: gds_origin
    connection: cupillar_opt2
    orientation: flip_chip
    layout: ./Metal_Test.gds
    top_cell: Metal_Test
    position:
      x: 1503.584    # die center in interposer-local frame
      y: 1822.939
      z: 61.83       # see §3
    dimensions:
      width: 770.0
      height: 2606.339
      thickness: 0
```

---

## 3. Z-Mounting Rule

### 3.1 Formula

For dies that mount on a connection stack (cu-pillar, solder bump,
etc.):

```
z_die = mounting_surface + connection.total_height()
```

where:
- `mounting_surface` = `z_bottom` of the interposer stackup layer
  whose name matches the connection stack's first layer.
- `connection.total_height()` = sum of `height` for every layer in
  the connection stack.

### 3.2 Worked example (wire-bond demo)

Interposer technology: `interposer_tech` (IHP SG13G2 BEOL).
Die connection: `cupillar_opt2` (PacTech, two layers: CuPillar 32 µm
+ SnAgCap 16 µm = total 48 µm).

`cupillar_opt2.layers[0].name` = `CuPillar`. The interposer stackup
contains a layer named `TopMetal2` whose `z_bottom = 13.83`. The
connection stack physically attaches to TopMetal2.

The connection stack's first layer name (`CuPillar`) does not appear
in the interposer stackup — the common case for visualization-only
stacks. The lookup then falls back as follows:

```
1. Look up cupillar_opt2.layers[0].name = "CuPillar" in interposer
   stackup. NOT FOUND.
2. Fallback: use the interposer's physical thickness as the mounting
   surface, OR — in the chiplet-studio implementation — the
   stackup's last "real" layer top (TopMetal2, z_top = 13.83).
3. mounting_surface = 13.83.
4. z_die = 13.83 + 48 = 61.83 µm.
```

### 3.3 Reference implementation

`chiplet-studio/src/core/Assembly.cpp::calculate_component_z`.

```cpp
// Mounting surface = z_bottom of the chosen connection stack's first
// layer (the layer that physically attaches to the interposer pad,
// e.g. CuPillar for cu-pillar stacks). Looking it up in the
// interposer stackup gives the exact passivation-opening / pad-top
// height. Adding stack->total_height() then lands the die on the
// tip of the connection.
```

### 3.4 Edge cases (must be handled by reader)

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Die has no `connection:` field | **Fallback**: use `interposer.thickness`. |
| `connection_stack` not defined in technology | **Fallback**: use `interposer.thickness`. |
| Connection's first layer not in interposer stackup | **Fallback**: use `interposer.thickness`. |
| Die has `position.z` explicitly set non-zero | Use the explicit value, do not auto-calculate. |

---

## 4. Writer Contract

Every tool that writes a `.chiplet` file MUST:
1. Express all `position:` x, y in the canonical frame (§1).
2. Use geometric center semantics (§1.4).
3. Declare `anchor:` explicitly per component (§2).
4. Set `z` to either the explicit user value, 0 to defer to
   auto-calc, or the auto-calculated value per §3.

### 4.1 KiCad `export_chiplet.cpp`

**Path:** `kicad/pcbnew/exporters/export_chiplet.cpp`

KiCad cannot produce the canonical frame on its own — it does not
read the interposer GDS. The pipeline therefore keeps two steps and
formalizes them: KiCad emits an **intermediate** file (positions in
PCB-bbox-corner), and `hyp_to_gds.py --update-chiplet-file` finalizes
it into the canonical frame.

KiCad's responsibilities:
- Add a `_metadata:` block at the top of the YAML so consumers know
  the file is intermediate:
  ```yaml
  _metadata:
    frame: pcb-bbox-corner
    finalize_required: true
    finalizer: hyp_to_gds.py --update-chiplet-file
  ```
- Emit `anchor:` per component (`bbox_center` for the interposer,
  `gds_origin` for dies that came from `gds_to_kicad`).
- chiplet-studio MUST refuse to load files where
  `_metadata.finalize_required: true`.

A tighter integration — KiCad invoking `hyp_to_gds.py` automatically
so a single action yields the canonical file — is deferred (see §8,
Future Work). It requires `hyp_to_gds.py` to be discoverable from
KiCad's runtime (PATH, plugin packaging, or bundling), which is a
distribution-level change.

### 4.2 `hyp_to_gds.py::update_chiplet_file`

**Path:**
`kicad_designs/kicad_interposer_hyperlynx_to_gds/hyp_to_gds.py`

This finalizer is the only place that owns the interposer GDS bbox,
so it performs the frame conversion:
- Interposer `position:` → GDS-bbox-center.
- Die `position:` → re-anchored to GDS-bbox-corner.
- io_pad `position:` → re-anchored to GDS-bbox-corner using the same
  `(gds_left, gds_bottom)` shift applied to dies:
  ```python
  for pad in component['io_pads']:
      pad['position']['x'] -= gds_left
      pad['position']['y'] -= gds_bottom
  ```
- Emit `anchor:` per component (interposer `bbox_center`, dies
  `gds_origin`; io_pads inherit the interposer frame and declare no
  anchor of their own).
- Cite this document in a comment near the conversion:
  `# Per chiplet-studio/docs/coord_frame_contract.md §1, position is
  in GDS-bbox-corner frame, geometric center.`
- Strip the `_metadata` block on output — the canonical `.chiplet`
  carries no `finalize_required` marker.

The interposer override and die re-anchor are the finalizer's
legitimate job: KiCad emits in PCB-bbox-corner and does not own the
GDS bbox, so converting PCB-bbox-corner → GDS-bbox-corner for any
design where PCB-bbox ≠ GDS-bbox must happen here.

### 4.3 `hyp_to_gds.py::add_io_pads` and the JSON producer

**Path:** `hyp_to_gds.py::add_io_pads` consumes `io_pads.json`
produced by `kicad_pcb_to_iopads.py`.

The JSON may remain in HYP-absolute coordinates — it feeds GDS-side
placement, which lives in absolute coords. The conversion to
GDS-bbox-corner is the responsibility of `update_chiplet_file`
(§4.2), which owns the GDS bbox lookup.

### 4.4 `gds_to_kicad` (footprint origin convention)

**Path:** `gds_to_kicad/gds_to_kicad.py`

The tool sets the KiCad footprint reference text at `(at 0 0)`,
placing the footprint origin at GDS cell (0, 0). Pads are placed at
their GDS-derived `(center_x, center_y)` relative to (0, 0). The
`--flip-chip` flag mirrors X only.

This convention is the reason dies declare `anchor: gds_origin` —
their GDS (0,0) is the reference point KiCad uses.

### 4.5 Future writers

Any new tool emitting `.chiplet` files (manual editor, plugin,
script) MUST cite this document by path in a comment near the writer
code. Reviewers MUST reject writers that don't.

---

## 5. Reader Contract

Every tool that reads a `.chiplet` file MUST:
1. Parse `anchor:` and store it on the component.
2. Use `anchor:` (not `ComponentType`) to drive mesh centering.
3. Validate position values are in plausible range; warn loudly if
   any `position.x` or `position.y` exceeds 1e5 µm (heuristic
   indicator of HYP-absolute leakage).

### 5.1 `chiplet-studio/src/formats/ChipletFormat.cpp`

- Parse the `anchor:` field per component (default to `bbox_center`
  on absence with `[chiplet] WARN: anchor not declared, defaulting to
  bbox_center`).
- Reject files declaring `_metadata.finalize_required: true` with a
  clear error: `error: this .chiplet is intermediate (PCB-bbox-corner
  frame); run hyp_to_gds.py --update-chiplet-file to finalize`.
- Validate `|position.x|, |position.y| < 1e5 µm` per component;
  warn on violation.

### 5.2 `chiplet-studio/src/view3d/LayerMeshBuilder.cpp`

Mesh centering is driven by the component's `anchor`, expressed as an
`Anchor` enum (`GdsOrigin` or `BboxCenter`) rather than a
caller-computed boolean. When the anchor is `BboxCenter`, the builder
centers the mesh on its GDS bounding box:

```cpp
if (has_polygons && anchor == Anchor::BboxCenter) {
    center_offset_x = (global_min_x + global_max_x) / 2.0;
    center_offset_y = (global_min_y + global_max_y) / 2.0;
}
```

The source of truth is the schema field, not a per-call flag.

### 5.3 `chiplet-studio/src/view3d/AssemblyView.cpp`

Resolve the anchor from the component, not from `ComponentType`:

```cpp
Anchor anchor = comp.anchor();
```

Pass `anchor` to `LayerMeshBuilder`. The chiplet → 3D world
coordinate mapping is:

```cpp
geometry.transform.translate(
    static_cast<float>(pos.x / 1000.0),    // chiplet X -> 3D X (mm)
    static_cast<float>(pos.z / 1000.0),    // chiplet Z -> 3D Y (mm)
    static_cast<float>(-pos.y / 1000.0));  // chiplet Y -> 3D -Z (mm)
```

The flipZ scale is orthogonal to anchor and unchanged.

### 5.4 `chiplet-studio/src/core/Component.h` / `IOPad.h`

- Add `enum class Anchor { GdsOrigin, BboxCenter }` in a new header
  `chiplet-studio/src/core/Anchor.h` (or inline in `Component.h`).
- Add `Anchor m_anchor = Anchor::BboxCenter` to `Component` with
  `anchor()` getter and `set_anchor()` setter.
- Add string conversion helpers:
  `anchor_to_string(Anchor)` and `string_to_anchor(const std::string&)`.
- Update the `IOPad` position doc comment from
  ```
  2D pad position in micrometers (interposer-global coordinates).
  ```
  to
  ```
  2D pad position in micrometers, in the canonical frame defined in
  chiplet-studio/docs/coord_frame_contract.md (interposer-local,
  GDS-bbox-corner).
  ```

### 5.5 `chiplet-studio/src/core/Assembly.cpp::calculate_component_z`

For dies with a missing `connection` or an undefined
`connection_stack`, fall back to `interposer.thickness` rather than
returning 0:

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `comp.connection().empty()` | `mounting_surface = interposer.thickness; total_height = 0` |
| `connection_stack(comp.connection())` returns null | same as above |
| First layer name not in interposer stackup | fall back to `interposer.thickness` |

The Z-mounting formula §3 holds in all cases.

---

## 6. io_pads Convention

### 6.1 Frame

io_pads `position:` lives in the same canonical frame as components
(GDS-bbox-corner of the interposer top_cell, geometric center of the
pad, µm). io_pads are nested under their interposer in the schema and
inherit the interposer's frame. They do **not** declare an `anchor:`
field — they are points (size is 2D extent, not a centering rule).

### 6.2 Validation

io_pads must be re-anchored to the canonical frame by the finalizer
(§4.2). A reader MUST warn (or reject) when `|position.x|` or
`|position.y|` exceeds 1e5 µm: the interposer GDS bbox is on the
order of a few thousand µm, so values that large indicate
HYP-absolute coordinates leaking through un-converted. io_pads are
stored as metadata and not currently rendered in 3D, but their
positions must still be canonical for any downstream consumer.

---

## 7. Verification Fixtures

Three fixtures, all required.

### 7.1 Synthetic fixture (unit test)

**Files:**
- `chiplet-studio/tests/fixtures/coord_contract_synth.chiplet`
- `chiplet-studio/tests/test_coord_frame_contract.cpp`

**Fixture contents:**
- 1 interposer, 1000 × 1000 µm, `anchor: bbox_center`,
  `position: (500, 500, 0)`.
- 2 dies of 100 × 100 µm thickness 50, `anchor: gds_origin`:
  - Die A at `position: (250, 250, 50)`.
  - Die B at `position: (750, 750, 50)`.
- 4 io_pads at the corners of the interposer:
  `(50, 50)`, `(950, 50)`, `(50, 950)`, `(950, 950)`.

**Test assertions:**
- `Component::anchor()` returns the parsed value for each component.
- After loading, the interposer's resolved 3D world position
  (computed via the same code path as `AssemblyView`) is
  `(0.5, 0.0, -0.5) mm` (or whatever follows from the canonical
  mapping; spell out the exact expected vector in the test).
- Die A's 3D world position is `(0.25, 0.05, -0.25) mm`.
- Die B's 3D world position is `(0.75, 0.05, -0.75) mm`.
- io_pad positions parse correctly and are stored verbatim.

### 7.2 Demo round-trip (integration test)

**Trigger:** regenerate `interposer_wire_bonding_demo.chiplet`
end-to-end via KiCad export + `hyp_to_gds.py --update-chiplet-file`.

**Test assertion (in `test_coord_frame_contract.cpp`):**
load the regenerated `.chiplet`, find U1, assert:
- `U1.anchor() == Anchor::GdsOrigin`
- `U1.position().z == 61.83 ± 0.01 µm` (sum of TopMetal2 z_top +
  cupillar_opt2 total_height)
- For each U1 pad-on-TopMetal2 in the U1 GDS, its world XY is
  within 1 µm of the closest cu-pillar SnAgCap cap center on the
  interposer.

This is the round-trip regression net for the contract.

### 7.3 KLayout-independent check (geometric verification)

**File:**
`kicad_designs/kicad_interposer_hyperlynx_to_gds/tests/check_complete_gds_alignment.py`

**Behavior:**
- Take a `*_complete.gds` path as argument.
- Use klayout pya to:
  - Find the `TOP` cell.
  - Locate U1's flipped instance (cell name pattern
    `*_flipped` or via the U1 reference in connection_stacks).
  - Compute U1's flipped-instance bbox in TOP coords.
  - Compute the cu-pillar array bbox in TOP coords (filter by the
    cu-pillar layer pair).
  - Assert: U1 bbox and cu-pillar array bbox overlap; centroid
    distance within 1 µm.
- Exit 0 on success, non-zero with a clear message on mismatch.

This script is independent of chiplet-studio so a chiplet-studio
bug cannot mask a real GDS misalignment.

### 7.4 Running all three

```bash
# 1. Unit tests (chiplet-studio synthetic + round-trip)
cd chiplet-studio/build
./tests/chiplet_tests --gtest_filter='CoordFrameContract*'

# 2. Demo regen
cd kicad_designs/kicad_interposer_hyperlynx_to_gds
python3 hyp_to_gds.py \
  --hyp ../../interposer_wire_bonding_demo/test.hyp \
  --update-chiplet-file ../../interposer_wire_bonding_demo/interposer_wire_bonding_demo.chiplet

# 3. KLayout-independent geometric check
python3 tests/check_complete_gds_alignment.py \
  ../../interposer_wire_bonding_demo/interposer_wire_bonding_demo_complete.gds
```

All three must pass before declaring this contract implemented.

---

## 8. Future Work

KiCad's "Export Chiplet" GUI action could integrate the
Hyperlynx + GDS pipeline so a single action produces the canonical
`.chiplet` without a separate `hyp_to_gds.py` invocation. All
information `hyp_to_gds.py` consumes is already present in the
Hyperlynx file KiCad produces. Scope:

1. KiCad's "Export Chiplet" action also emits the `.hyp` file.
2. The action invokes (or bundles) `hyp_to_gds.py
   --update-chiplet-file` to finalize.
3. The intermediate `_metadata.finalize_required: true` marker
   becomes unnecessary.

This is a refactor of the invocation flow, not a redesign of the
contract.

---

## Appendix A — Glossary of Coordinate Frames

The frames present in the toolchain:

| # | Frame | Origin | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | KiCad PCB internal nm | KiCad's signed int IU (nm) | KiCad core; not exposed to .chiplet |
| 2 | PCB-bbox-corner | Lower-left of `BoardEdgesBoundingBox` (or fallback) | KiCad `export_chiplet.cpp` for dies and io_pads |
| 3 | PCB-bbox-center | (PCB_w/2, PCB_h/2) | KiCad `export_chiplet.cpp` for the interposer |
| 4 | HYP absolute | Hyperlynx file native (meters, KiCad y-down convention pre-conversion) | `hyp_to_gds.py` input parsing |
| 5 | GDS absolute | GDS file native (µm, y-up cartesian) | KLayout, hyp_to_gds.py for cell instance placement |
| 6 | **GDS-bbox-corner** ← canonical | Lower-left of interposer GDS bbox | **THIS CONTRACT.** Also `update_chiplet_file` for dies. |
| 7 | GDS-bbox-center | (GDS_w/2, GDS_h/2) | `update_chiplet_file` for the interposer |
| 8 | Interposer-local-corner | The frame components mean to be in (per the `IOPad` position comment) | The schema's intent. Now formalized as = #6. |
| 9 | Chiplet-studio 3D world | OpenGL world (mm, y-up, z-out-of-screen) | `AssemblyView` final placement |

From the schema's perspective only #6 (canonical) and #9 (3D world)
are visible. The rest are internal to specific tools and never appear
in `.chiplet` files.
